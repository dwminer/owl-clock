//  On the Arduino doubles are still only 4 bytes, but we need better precision in order to
//  do astronomical calculations like when the solstices are, etc.  In order to support that I
//  adapted this lib which gives you a float64 which is made up of two 4 byte floats, that can
//  be operated on at a higher precision.  (A bit more like a real double)
//  Read the included paper for more details.
