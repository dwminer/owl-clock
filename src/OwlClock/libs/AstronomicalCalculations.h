// In theory the day can have a factional part that should be included, but

// have an impact.  Not sure if that's because we are using FAKE sin/cos or if
// it's something else.  Saddly this means you can't really use the output of this
// to compute the exact hour of the peak of the new moon, etc.  It is however good
// enough for reasonable sense of how full the moon will be on a given day.
