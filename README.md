2015 Christmas Project

I built six of these owl clocks in the run up to Christmas 2015.
It uses edge lit acrylic sheets to act as psudo Nixie Tubes. The clock uses an ATMEGA328p at it's core. The display is powered but 40 [WS2812b] (https://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf) RGB leds.
I have a [blog post] (https://retrotechjournal.com/2016/04/04/plexitube-owl-clock/) with a longer write up of the project.
